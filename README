This library has commands created for (application level) forward error correction for OreSat.

Currently, everything is written as a stream input/output.

Still need to optomize. 
	- using unsigned chars all over the place is inefficient depending on regs
	- can probably reduce memory usage if necessary
	- validate input, return errors

Functions:
	hamming (7,4) encoding and decoding (it's FEC and it works)
		- create educational write-up
		- now can be used to correct packet loss (verify)

	modern-grade FEC encoding and decoding (it's better FEC and it works better)
		- decide on which code to concatenate with (probably LDPC)
		- Reed-solomon function currently not working.

	emergency mode encoding and decoding (for very high bit error rate)
		- calculate how much n/k to be sent in a 2 minute window
		- two emergency modes: with and without assuming UDP packets
		- investigate fountain codes' suitability

	UDP packet header adder
		- Basic UDP packet adder, for one packet and for a stream, created.
		- Converting a stream into a stream of UDP packets functionality added
			(packets all same)

	Various functions for testing FEC protocols.
		- Made: function for altering bits ever n bytes; random bit error simulator, 
			UDP decoder with packet loss simulator
